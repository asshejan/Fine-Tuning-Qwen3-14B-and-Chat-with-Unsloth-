# Fine-Tuning-Qwen3-14B-and-Chat-with-Unsloth-
This repository demonstrates how to efficiently fine-tune the Qwen3-14B model for both mathematical reasoning and conversational chat using the Unsloth library. The process involves mixed-dataset preparation, LoRA configuration, training, and saving the model in multiple formats, including GGUF for llama.cpp.
